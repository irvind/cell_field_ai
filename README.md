# Cell Field AI

Cell Field AI is an example of a genetic algorithm implementation. The algorithm finds the best solution among the population by using a feedforward neural network.

## What is a cell field?

The cell field is a 3x3 integer matrix, each cell of which contains value between 0 and 10. The cell field becomes complete if each cell is greater or equal to 1.
